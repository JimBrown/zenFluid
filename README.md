ZenFluid theme for ZenPhoto20
==================================

ZenFluid is a browser responsive theme for ZenPhoto20. It will resize images and videos to fit the current browser window, as well as whenever the browser window size is changed.

It is based on the Zenpage CMS plugin default theme. It requires the Zenpage and print_album_menu plugins (this will be enabled automatically). It also has support for my Facebook_like, GoogleAdsense and GoogleAnalytics plugins.
