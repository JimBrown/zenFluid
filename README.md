ZenFluid theme for ZenPhoto 1.4.6+
==================================

ZenFluid is a browser responsive theme for ZenPhoto. It will resize images and videos to fit the current browser window, as well as whenever the browser window size is changed.

It is based on the Zenpage CMS plugin default theme. It supports the print_album_menu plugin(this will need to be enabled for album links in the sidebar). It also has support for my GoogleAdsense and GoogleAnalytics plugins.
